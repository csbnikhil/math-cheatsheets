## Number System

### Comparing Numbers

- When you have two numbers with different number of digits, the one with the larger number of digits is the larger number. [Note: 0's in the leftmost postion are insignificant.]
- If they have the same number of digits, you start from the left and start comparing indie digits. If you find digits that differ, the number in possession of the greater digit is the larger number.

### Making Charts for Comparing Numbers

### Forming Numbers With the Given Digits

With $5$, $8$, $7$, $6$, $0$, $2$, form the smallest and the largest number possible.

#### Forming the Smallest

Arrange the digits in the ascending (increasing) order.

> If the given digits contain a 0, the next smallest digit should be at the extreme left, and 0 to its immediate right.

$205678$

#### Forming the Largest

Arrange the digits in the descending (decreasing) order.

$876520$

#### How many number can you make?

Given a number of digits, how many different numbers can you form, without repeating any of the digits, using all the digits?

$3$, $2$ -> 2\
$4$, $2$, $3$, $8$ -> 24\
$6$, $0$, $4$, $7$, -> 18### Operations on Large Numbers

## Estimation

Estimation is a rough calculation meant to give you an idea about a quantity.
E. g. If your score is 89%, you'll probably say that you scored about 90%.

### Round Offs

#### Nearests Tens

- Replace the ones digit by 0.
- If the units digit was greater than 5, add one to the tens digit.

#### Nearest Hundreds

- Replace the ones and hundreds digit by 0.
- If the hundreds digit was greater than 5, add one to the thousands digit.

#### Nearest Thousands

- Replace the ones, hundreds and thousands digit by 0.
- If the thousands digit was greater than 5, add one to the ten thousands digit.

### Estimation of Numbers

The attendance for a football match was 71,000. And it was streamed by 85 million people.
This is a real life example of estimation, because we can't exactly have those number of people, but those definitely give an idea of the amount of watchers.

One more example would be when a friend asks you about time. You wouldn't normally say it's 1:37 PM, but something like 1:40, or 20 minutes to 2.
You gave your friend an estimate of time.

### Approximation

Meaning: nearest to the actual amount/value.

When finding an area of an irregular figure, you approximate by fitting small unit squares inside the fig.

### More on Estimation

The procedure of estimation requires the following factors to be considered:
1. Degree of Accuracy
1. Simplicity of Computation
1. Speed
    1. Estimation
    1. Guessed Answer

#### Estimating Sums

To calculate a sum to its nearest tens -
1. Round off the numbers to their nearest 10s.
1. Add the rounded off numbers.

Similar rules apply for estimating to the nearest hundreds, thousands, ...

## Numbers in Indian and International Systems

### Unit

In math, a unit means a single thing.
A unit is the first and lowest natural number as a standard of measurment.
E. g. a meter, a day, ...

The number written before the name of a unit indicates how many times that unit is taken.
E. g. 8 m => a meter is taken 8 times. My weight is 60 kg. A unit kg equals 1 kg. 60 kg => 1 kg is taken 60 times.

### Numeral

A numeral is a symbol representing a given number.

153 is the number. 1, 5 and 3 are the numerals used to represent the number.

### Numeration

Represents a number a number in words.

83 is the number. `Eighty three` is its numeration.

## Place Value

In a number the, the place (local) value of a non-0 digit is the its value according to its position.

7829:

8's local value = 8 x 100 = 800

> **Note**: The place value of 0 will always be 0.

> Examples on the fly.

> A **Concrete Number** is a a number which refers to a particular unit and is meaningful, such as 18 km, 2 l, ... And a number that does not refer to anything is an **Abstract Number**.

#### Questions

- What is the unit in the number 56 m?
- How many times is a unit taken in 87 kg?
- Write the numerals and the numeration of the number 266.
- What is the place value of 8 in the number 578345?

### Largest and Smallest Numbers

- What is the largest one digit number?
- What is the largest three digit number?
- What is the largest seven digit number?
- What is the smallest two digit number?
- What is the smallest three digit number?

You can see some patterns here.
1. The largest `n` digit number is formed by having the largest one digit number at all places, which makes sense, because you want to have the maximum value at every place.
1. Adding 1 to a largest `n` digit number will give you the smallest `n + 1` digit number.
1. Subtracting 1 from the smallest `n` digit number will give you the largest `n - 1` digit number.

## Natural and Whole Numbers

Natural Numbers are those that count things in the nature. Like the number of legs a dog has. The number of eyes a human has. The number of shoes that you own...


The set of natural numbers:

$N = \{1, 2, 3, 4, ...\}$

- The first and the smallest natural number is 1.
- The last/greatest natural number cannot be obtained, because there are infinite number of natural numbers.
- The difference between any two consecutive natural numbers is 1. In fact, you can define **consecutive** in that manner.

Whole Numbers are Natural Numbers + 0.

The set of whole numbers:

$W = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...\}$

> Note: A whole number is either 0 or a natural number.

- The first and the smallest of Whole Numbers is 0.
- The last/greatest natural number cannot be obtained, because there are infinite number of natural numbers.
- The difference between any two consecutive natural numbers is 1.

### Successors and Predecessors

$a$ is a **successor** of $b$, if $a = b + 1$.
$a$ is a **predecessor** of $b$, if $a = b - 1$.

#### The Number Line

- **Successor** is a number that is one step to the right.
- **Predecessor** is a number that is one step to the left.

For $N$, the line starts from 1, and for $W$, it starts from 0.

The *predecessor* for 0 and 1 do not exist for $W$ and $N$ respectively.

### Properties of Whole Numbers

#### Closure Property

An operation is said to be closed under a set of numbers, when the operation results in a number of the same set, every time.

Operations closed under $N$: $+, \times$
Operations closed under $W$: $+, \times$

#### Commutative Property

An operation is commutative if the result remains the same when the order of operands is reversed.

$+$ and $\times$ follow this for both $N$ and $W$.

$a + b = b + a$\
$a \times b = b \times a$#### Associative Property

An operation is said to be associative if the result remains the same even when the order of operations is changed.

$+$ and $\times$ follow this for both $N$ and $W$.

$a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$\
$a \times (b \times c) = (a \times b) \times c$#### Identity

For every operation, there exists a number $n$, which when operated against any number $a$, preserves the value of $a$.

|Operation|Inverese|
|:-------:|:------:|
|$+$      | $0$    |
|$-$      | $0$    |
|$\times$ | $1$    |
|$\div$   | $1$    |

$a + 0 = a$\
$a - 0 = a$\
$a \times 1 = a$\
$a \div 1 = a$#### Inverse

An inverse is a number, which when operated against a number gives the result as the operation's identity.

|Operation|Inverse |
|:-------:|:------:|
|$+$      | $-n$   |
|$-$      | $n$    |
|$\times$ | $\frac{1}{n}$|
|$\div$   | $n$    |

#### Cancellation Law of Addition

$x + y = y + z$, implies $x = z$.

### Patterns

A pattern is a repitive arrangement. You can find them in shapes, numbers, ...

E. g. $1,1,2,3,5,8,...$

#### With Whole and Natural Numbers

$1 + 3 = 4 = 2\times{2} = 2^2$\
$1 + 3 + 5 = 9 = 3\times{3} = 3^2$\
$1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 = 4\times{4} = 4^2$The sum of first of first $N$ odd natural numbers is $N^2$.

When you sum the first $N$ natural numbers, the pattern that you get is not as easy as this to find, but there is a pattern. It will always be equal to $\frac{N(N + 1)}{2}$.

$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15$\
$2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20$\
$3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 25$$1\times{1} = 1$\
$11\times{11} = 121$\
$111\times{111} = 12321$### Magic Square

It's an arrangement of different whole numbers in the form of a square such that the sum of the numbers is the same along all the verticals, the horizontals and the diagonals.

```
2 9 4
7 5 3
6 1 6
```

### Matchstick Patterns

Each of the patterns to be discussed below is called a matchstick pattern as different shapes or diagrams can be constructed with matchsticks.

#### Squares

You need 4 of them. When you use 3 more, you can form 2 squares. And with 3 more, you can form 3 squares, ...

$M = 3n + 1$

#### Triangles

You need 3 of them. Consecutively add 2 to increase the number of triangles.

$M = 2n + 1$

#### More Patterns

$1\times{9} + 1 = 10$\
$12\times{9} + 2 = 110$\
$123\times{9} + 3 = 1110$$1\times{8} + 1 = 9$\
$12\times{8} + 2 = 98$\
$123\times{8} + 3 = 987$$9\times{9} + 7 = 88$\
$98\times{9} + 6 = 888$\
$987\times{9} + 5 = 8888$$111\div3=37$\
$222\div6=37$\
$333\div9=37$### Problems on Magic Square

## Negative Numbers and Integers

Where do the negative numbers come from?
When discussing the closure property, we said that only $\times$ and $+$ were closed under $W$. What happens when we subtract a larger whole number from a smaller whole number? We get a new kind of number that would be out of our then Number Line. These numbers are called the negative numbers.

Where do you see negative numbers in reality?

Temperature, indicating losses, velocity, ...

Below are some negative numbers:
`-2 ˚C`, `-45`, `-18 m/s`

You notice that a `-` is prefixed to all the negative numbers. When it is not present, it is understoof that it is a +ve number.

When you consider any negative number, it has two parts: magnitude and sign.
In the number $-12 m/s$, $12$ is the magnitude and $-$ is its sign.
In the number $37$, $37$ is the magnitude, and $+$ is its sign.

> **Note**: $0$ is a neutral number. It is neither negative, not positive.

### The Number Line

Negative numbers fall to the left of $0$.

### Ordering

- $a$ is greater than $b$, if $a$ is to the right of $b$ on the number line.
- $a$ is less than $b$, if $a$ is to the left of $b$ on the number line.

> Examples on the fly.

### Addition and Subtraction of Integers

Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting a positive number of the same magnitude.

$3-5=3+(-5)$

When you add or subtract, you move to the left or right of the number line, depending on the magnitude and sign of the added or subtracted number.

> Examples on the fly.

## Number Line

A number line can be used to represent all kinds of numbers, but we will only be discussing about integers in this chapter.

### Drawing the Number Line

- Straight Line
- Divide into equal parts
- Decide the position of $0$
- Positive numbers to the right
- Negative numbers to the left
- Arrow heads
    - Whole Numbers and Natural Numbers extend only to the right.
    - Integers extend at both ends.

### Using the Line to Compare Numbers
* righter the number, greater the number
* lefter the number, smaller the number

### Using the Line to Add

- $+$ means move right, $-$ means move left.
- The number you land at, is the answer.

### Using the Line to Subtract

- Mark both the numbers on the line.
- Count the number of steps you need to take from the first number to the second number.
- The magnitude of the answer is the number of steps that you took.
- If you moved left, sign will be negative.
