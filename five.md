## Number Systems

What are numbers?

* Draw an object multiple times on the screen.
* Ask to count.
* The answer to that is going to be a **number**.

How many 1s in a 10?
How many 10s in a 100?
...

When it comes to reading large numbers like 100000, we have a system
to read them with ease - the **Indian and International Number Systems**.

### Periods

A period is a group of digits (usually seperated by `,`).

### Indian Number System

#### Periods

- ones
- thousands
- lakhs
- crores

### International Number System

- ones
- thousands
- millions
- billions

### Place & Face Values

2980346: place value of `4` = `400`, face value = `4`

### Expansion

8123 = 3x1 + 2x10 + 3x100 + 8x1000

### Successors and Predecessors

13 is the successor of 12
89 is the predecessor of 90

### Comparison of Numbers

`>`, `<` and `=`

#### Ascending and Descending Orders

#### Forming The Smallest or The Largest Number

Available Digits: 8, 4, 5, 7, 3

largest  = 87543
smallest = 34578

## Roman Numerals

Ancient number system that Romans used before 0, 1, 2, 3, ... came into existence.

Symbol  | Number
:-----: | :----:
I       | 1
V       | 5
X       | 10
L       | 50
C       | 100
D       | 500
M       | 1000

### Rules

* I, X, C, and M can be repeated 3 times only.
> **Note**: 
* Greater number first, smaller number next - add
* Smaller number first, greater number next - subtract
* If a smaller numeral is placed between two greater numerals, it is subtracted from the one on the right.
* To multiply a value by `1000` a small bar called the _vinculum_ is put over the numeral.

> **Notes**: 
> 1. V, L and D are never repeated or subtracted.
> 1. I can be subtracted from V and X only.
> 1. X can be subtracted from L and C only.
> 1. C can be subtracted from D and M only.
> 1. A letter of smaller can be written to the left of a larger value only once. The same numeral cannot be subtracted more than once.


### Procedure

#### Decimal -> Roman

* Write the decimal expansion.
* Write a Roman Numeral for each part.
* Remove +'s.

#### Roman -> Decimal

* Seperate the combinations used to form the number.
* Write the number for each part.
* Add the parts.

> **Why can't 8 be represented as IIX?**
You can only add or subtract the numbers that have a one character representation in Roman Numerals. 10 - 2 = 8, but 2 cannot be written by using a single Roman Numeral. (Note 5) [color=#6c5b7b]

## BODMAS

Form `16` with `3`, `5` and `2`.

### Precedence

#### Operators

0. of
1. Division
2. Multiplication 
3. Addition; Subtraction

#### Brackets

1. Bar
2. Common / Round
3. Curly
4. Square

## Fractions

Divide a cake in a way that everyone gets an equal amount to eat.

A number of the form $\frac{N}{D}$, where `N` and `D` are integers, is called a **Fraction**.

### Types of Fractions

- Like
- Unlike
- Proper
- Improper
- Mixed
- Equivalent
- Reciprocal

### Reduction

Divide the `N` and `D` with the `HCF` of `N` and `D`.

$\frac{18}{12} = \frac{3}{2}$

### Comparison

### Addition

### Multiplication

- With a Whole Number
- With a Fraction

### Division

A cake is already into halves, further divisions of the cake will yield a fourth of the cake to everyone. Multiplication of proper fractions will get you a smaller number.

${\frac{2}{7}}\div\frac{3}{4} = \frac{2}{7}\times\frac{4}{3}$

## Negative Numbers

Briefing: known sets of numbers - Natural, Whole.

Where do you see negative numbers? What do they represent? [loss, temperature, ...]
### The Number Line

#### Addition

Move to the right.

> **Note**: Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting a positive number.


#### Subtraction

Move to the left.

## Average

A batsman scores `30, 47, 68, 51` runs in different matches.
A football team scores `3, 0, 2, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1` goals in different matches.

- It's a measure of performance.
- A football team with a higher average tends to score a lot of goals.
- A batsman with a higher average is expected to score well in all the matches.
- $Average = \frac{Sum of Quantities}{Total Number of Quantities}$

### Finding the Sum of Quantities given the Average

- Average speed of a bus = 67 km/h
Total time taken = 8 h
Distance = ?

- Average marks scored by a student = 83
Total number of subjects = 5
Total marks scored by the student = ?

## Estimation

If you scored 85 marks, you'd say you scored about 90 marks.
You might have seen items costing 99, but you say you bought it for a 100.

## Factors and Multiples

Revise tests of divisibility.

### Terms

- **Prime Number**
    - A number > 1, that has only two factors: 1 and itself.
    - E. g. 17
    - 1 is neither prime, nor composite, because the definition of a Prime Number says it should have 2 prime factors.
> **Fact**: 2 is the only even prime number. [color=#f0c000]

- **Multiple**
    - We say that a number `a` is a multiple of another number `b`, if we can get `b` by multiplying `a` with a **whole** number.
- **Factor**
    - We say that a number `a` is a factor of another number `b`, if we get a __remainder__ of `0`, when we divide `b` by `a`.
- **Prime Factor**
    - A factor which is a prime number.
- **Co-Prime Numbers**
    - Two numbers `a` and `b` are _co-prime_ if they do not have a common factor other than 1. Or, when `HCF(a, b) = 1`.
    - E. g. 16 and 25
- **Twin Primes**
    - Consecutive Prime Numbers, the difference between whom is 2.
    - E . g. (3, 5), (11, 13), (41, 43)
    
### Properties

#### Factors

- 1 is a factor of every number.
- Every number is a factor of itself, except 0.
- Every number is a factor of 0.
- factor(n) <= n

#### Multiples

- 0 is a multiple of every number.
- Every number is a mulitple of itslef.
- Every number is a multiple of 1.
- multiple(n) >= n

### Highest Common Factor

Also known as **Greatest Common Divisor** and **Greatest Common Factor**.

Defined for two or more whole numbers, it is the greatest whole number that divides both the numbers.

#### Finding the HCF

- Listing
- Prime Factorisation
- Division
- Common Division

### Least Common Multiple

Defined for two or more numbers, it is the least number, that is a multiple of all the numbers.

#### Properties

- LCM of two prime numbers will always be equal to their product.
- If a number is a factor of another number, then their LCM will be equal to the larger number.
- LCM of a group of numbers will always be greater than, or equal to the largest number.
- LCM of two consecutive numbers will always equal the product of the two.

#### Finding the LCM

- Listing
- Prime Factorisation
- Common Division

### Relationship Between HCF & LCM

`HCF(a, b) x LCM(a, b) = a x b`

### Problems

- Largest 4 digit number which when divided by 6, 8, 12 and 20 leaves no remainder.
- LCM and HCF of two numbers are 720 and 5. If one of the two numbers is 45, find the other number.
- LCM of 576 and 128 is 1152. Find the HCF.

## Perimeter and Area

The distance around a plane figure is called the **perimeter**.

The amount of surface enclosed within the boundary of a figures is called its **area**.

### The Unit Square

+ A square of side 1 u. (u = cm, m, ...)
+ Area of a unit square will be unit area.
+ Any rectangle can be composed of unit squares. (Explain how $l\times{b}$ came into picture.)

### Approximating Areas

When you have an irregulary shaped figure, it's very difficult to find the exact area. But we can approximate its area by fitting unit squares inside the figure. Depending on the number of squares that the figure fills completely, more than half and less than half, we approximate the area.


### Problems

paving floors; finding the cost; perimeter of a garden; area of a path; areas of shapes that can be broken down into basic shapes;

## Decimal Fractions

$\frac{10}{8} = 1.125$

$1.125$ is read as `one point one two five` as opposed to `one point one twenty five`.

### Place Value

`1` is the integral part. `125` is the decimal part.

### Expansion

$108.125 = 1\times{100} + 0\times{10} + 8\times{1} + 1\times{\frac{1}{10}} + 2\times{\frac{1}{100}} + 5\times{\frac{1}{1000}}$

### Types

- Like
- Unlike
- Equivalent

### Comparison

$0.85 > 0.75$

### Conversion

$8.125 = 8.125\times{\frac{1000}{1000}}
= \frac{8125}{1000} = \frac{65}{8}$

$\frac{65}{8} = \frac{65\times{125}}{8\times{125}} = \frac{8125}{1000} = 8.125$

### Rounding Off 

### Arithmetic Operations

$+, -, \times, \div$
