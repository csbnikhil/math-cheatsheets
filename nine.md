## Real Numbers

Rational Numbers are those which can be written in the form p/q where q != 0.
But there are numbers which cannot be written as a fraction,
they have a decimal expansion with no repitition, but goes on and on forever.
For example, the Golden Number, Pi, square root of 2, ...\
These numbers are called irrational numbers. Rantional and Irrational Numbers
are together called Real Numbers, which is a set that encompasses every number
that exists on the Number Line.

### Finding n Rational Numbers

Consider $x$ and $y$ to belong to $Q$, and $y > x$.\
Find $d = \frac{y - x}{n + 1}$.\
You can go on finding terms by the following sequence: $x+d, x+2d, x+3d, ..., x+nd$

### Properties

Refer to [Class VIII]().

### Decimal Representation

#### Terminating and Non-Terminating

1 / 8 = 0.125\
12 / 5 = 2.4\
10 / 3 = 1.3333333333...

Explain (recurring | periodic | circulating) decimals, and also it's
period.

> A bar is used to represent the period.

### Irrational Numbers

Square Roots of not perfect squares, Cube Roots of not perfect cubes, are all
irrational numbers. Their decimal has no period, no recurrence, and they cannot be
written in the form of a fraction.

#### Proving that $\sqrt{2}$ is Irrational

#### Inserting an Irrational Number

If a and b are the numbers, a rational between them would be (a + b) / 2.\
And an irrational between them would be $\sqrt{a\times{b}}$.

### Examining the Irrationality

If an irration number is in the denominator, multiply that number to both the denominator
and the numerator.\
If $a+b\sqrt{c}$ is in the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by
$a-b\sqrt{c}$. Recall the Identitites.

### Surds

If x is a +ve Q and n is a positive integer, such that 1 over $x^n$ is irrational;
then $\frac{1}{x^n}$ is called a *surd*.

#### Rationalization

When two or more surds multiplied together to form a rational,
all those surds are called the rationalizing factors.

The process of rationalizing a surd by multiplying its rationalizing factor
is called *rationalization*.

> Explain how to find the least rationalizing factor.

##### Simplifying

Multiplying the denominator and the numerator by the **conjuagate** of the surd
in the denominator...

## Circles

A circle is a collection of points all of which are equidistant from a fixed point.

### Terms

* Center: The fixed point from which all the other points on the circle are at the same distance.
* Radius: The distance of any point on the circle from the center of the circle.
* Chord: A line joining any two points on the circle.
* Diameter: A __chord__ passing the center. [fact: a diameter will always be twice the radius]
* Segment: A part of a circle formed by a chord.
    * Major: Contains the center
    * Minor: Does not contain the center
* Sector: A part of a circle formed by two radii.
    * Major: Reflex angle at the center
    * Minor: An angle less than 180 deg. at the center


## Compound Interest

$Amount = Principal + Interest$,
where $Interest = \frac{P\times{R}\times{T}}{100}$

Compound Interest is a repeated Simple Interest, but increasing Principal.

> Explain the origin of $e$. Consider a hypothetical scenario where the interest is 100%
per year, and pricipal is 1, then increase the frequency of compounding.

### Formula

> Derive.

## Expansions

Recall Identities from [Class VIII]().

### $(a + b)^3$

> Expand.

- $a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b)$
- $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)^3 + 3ab(a - b)$

### Important Results

If $a+b+c=0$; then $a^3+b^3+c^3=3abc$.
> Prove.

### $(x+a)(x+b)$

> Expand and explain.

### $(a + b + c)^2$

## Factorization

- common terms
- grouping
- trinomials: splitting the middle term
- difference of two squares
- sum and difference of two cubes

## Simultaneous Equations

If there are two unknowns in 1 equation, the solution for the equation cannot be found
until another equation establishes a different relation among the two.
The relation will be another equation, and the two are called **simultaneous equations**.

### Methods

- Eliminations
    - Substitution
    - Coefficients
- Cross Multiplication

#### Explaining Cross Multiplication

Consider the following equations:

$a_1x + b_1y + c_1 = 0$\
$a_2x + b_2y + c_2 = 0$

### Reducible to Linear Equations

$\frac{4}{x} + \frac{7}{y} = 9$

## Indices

Refer to Exponents of [Class VIII]().

## Logarithms

Consider the exponential form $3^4 = 81$. In logarithms, we can express the same equations as:
$\log_3 81 = 4$, and read `log of 81 to the base 3 equals 4`.

### Laws

- Product: $\log_a (m\times n) = \log_a m + \log_a n$
- Quotient: $\log_a (m\div n) = \log_a m - \log_a n$
- Power: $\log_a m^n = n \log_a m$

## Conguency in Triangles

### Relation between Sides and Angles

- If the sides are all different, the angles will also be different,
in such a way that a greater side has a greater angle opposite ti it.
- Converse of the above point is also true.
- If two angles are equal, the sides opposite to those angles are also equal.
- If all the sides of a triangle are equal, all its angles will also be equal.
- Converse of the above statement is also true.

### Terms

- Median
- Altitude
- Centroid
- Orthocenter

### Corollaries

- If one side of a triangle is produced, the exterior angle so formed
is greater than each of the interior opposite angles.
- A triangle can't have more than one right angle.
- A triangle can't have more than one obtuse angle.
- In a right triangle, the the other two acute angles will be complementary.
- In every triangle, at least two angles are acute.
- If two angles of a triangle are equal to two angles of another triangle,
then the the third angle of the two triangles will also be equal.

### Congruent Triangles

Two triangles are said to be congruent, if all the sides and angles of both the triangles are equal.

#### Coonditions

- SSS
- SAS
- ASA
- AAS
- RHS

> **Important**: When writing triangles' congruency, we need to make sure that we write the corresponding sides in the same order.

## Isosceles Triangles

**Theorem 1**

If two sides of a triangle are equal, then the sides opposite to the two angles will also be equal.

**Theorem 2**

If two angles of a triangle are equal, then the sides opposite to the two angles will also be equal.

## Inequalities

### The Signs

$>$ is greater than.\
$<$ is less than.

**Theorem 3**

If two sides of a triangle are unequal, the greater sidehas the greater angle opposite to it.

**Theorem 4**

Converse of **Theorem 3**.

**Theorem 5**

Of all the lines that can be drawn to a given straight line from a given point outside it,
the perpendicular is the shortest.

### Corollaries

- The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle
is always greate than the greates side.
- The difference between any two sides is always less than the third side.
