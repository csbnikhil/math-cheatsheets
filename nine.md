## Real Numbers

Rational Numbers are those which can be written in the form p/q where q != 0.
But there are numbers which cannot be written as a fraction,
they have a decimal expansion with no repitition, but goes on and on forever.
For example, the Golden Number, Pi, square root of 2, ...\
These numbers are called irrational numbers. Rantional and Irrational Numbers
are together called Real Numbers, which is a set that encompasses every number
that exists on the Number Line.

### Finding n Rational Numbers

Consider $x$ and $y$ to belong to $Q$, and $y > x$.\
Find $d = \frac{y - x}{n + 1}$.\
You can go on finding terms by the following sequence: $x+d, x+2d, x+3d, ..., x+nd$

### Properties

Refer to [Class VIII]().

### Decimal Representation

#### Terminating and Non-Terminating

1 / 8 = 0.125\
12 / 5 = 2.4\
10 / 3 = 1.3333333333...

Explain (recurring | periodic | circulating) decimals, and also it's
period.

> A bar is used to represent the period.

### Irrational Numbers

Square Roots of not perfect squares, Cube Roots of not perfect cubes, are all
irrational numbers. Their decimal has no period, no recurrence, and they cannot be
written in the form of a fraction.

#### Proving that $\sqrt{2}$ is Irrational

#### Inserting an Irrational Number

If a and b are the numbers, a rational between them would be (a + b) / 2.\
And an irrational between them would be $\sqrt{a\times{b}}$.

### Examining the Irrationality

If an irration number is in the denominator, multiply that number to both the denominator
and the numerator.\
If $a+b\sqrt{c}$ is in the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by
$a-b\sqrt{c}$. Recall the Identitites.

### Surds

If x is a +ve Q and n is a positive integer, such that 1 over $x^n$ is irrational;
then $\frac{1}{x^n}$ is called a *surd*.

#### Rationalization

When two or more surds multiplied together to form a rational,
all those surds are called the rationalizing factors.

The process of rationalizing a surd by multiplying its rationalizing factor
is called *rationalization*.

> Explain how to find the least rationalizing factor.

##### Simplifying

Multiplying the denominator and the numerator by the **conjuagate** of the surd
in the denominator...

## Circles

A circle is a collection of points all of which are equidistant from a fixed point.

### Terms

* Center: The fixed point from which all the other points on the circle are at the same distance.
* Radius: The distance of any point on the circle from the center of the circle.
* Chord: A line joining any two points on the circle.
* Diameter: A __chord__ passing the center. [fact: a diameter will always be twice the radius]
* Arc: A part of the circumference.
* Segment: A part of a circle formed by a chord.
    * Major: Contains the center
    * Minor: Does not contain the center
* Sector: A part of a circle formed by two radii.
    * Major: Reflex angle at the center
    * Minor: An angle less than 180 deg. at the center

### Chords

## Mean and Median

$mean = $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$

To find the median of an ungrouped data,
arrange the data in ascending or descending order.
If there are odd data elements, the middle one will be the median, else the mean of the two middle terms will be the median.

### Properties of Mean

- $\sum (x - x') = 0$
- If each observation is increased by a quantity $a$, the new mean will be
$x' + a$
- If each observation is decreased by a quantity $a$, the new mean will be
$x' + a$
- ... $x' \times a$
- ... $x' \div a$

where $Interest = \frac{P\times{R}\times{T}}{100}$

Compound Interest is a repeated Simple Interest, but increasing Principal.

per year, and pricipal is 1, then increase the frequency of compounding.
