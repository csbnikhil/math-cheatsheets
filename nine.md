## Real Numbers

Rational Numbers are those which can be written in the form p/q where q != 0.
But there are numbers which cannot be written as a fraction,
they have a decimal expansion with no repitition, but goes on and on forever.
For example, the Golden Number, Pi, square root of 2, ...\
These numbers are called irrational numbers. Rantional and Irrational Numbers
are together called Real Numbers, which is a set that encompasses every number
that exists on the Number Line.

### Finding n Rational Numbers

Consider $x$ and $y$ to belong to $Q$, and $x > y$.\
Find $d = \frac{y - x}{n + 1}$.\
You can go on finding terms by the following sequence: $x+d, x+2d, x+3d, ..., x+nd$

### Properties

Refer to [Class VIII]().

### Decimal Representation

#### Terminating and Non-Terminating

1 / 8 = 0.125\
12 / 5 = 2.4\
10 / 3 = 1.3333333333...

Explain (recurring | periodic | circulating) decimals, and also it's
period.

> A bar is used to represent the period.

### Irrational Numbers

Square Roots of not perfect squares, Cube Roots of not perfect cubes, are all
irrational numbers. Their decimal has no period, no recurrence, and they cannot be
written in the form of a fraction.

#### Proving that $\sqrt{2}$ is Irrational

#### Inserting an Irrational Number

If a and b are the numbers, a rational between them would be (a + b) / 2.\
And an irrational between them would be $sqrt{a\times{b}}$.


## Circles

A circle is a collection of points all of which are equidistant from a fixed point.

### Terms

* Center: The fixed point from which all the other points on the circle are at the same distance.
* Radius: The distance of any point on the circle from the center of the circle.
* Chord: A line joining any two points on the circle.
* Diameter: A __chord__ passing the center. [fact: a diameter will always be twice the radius]
* Segment: A part of a circle formed by a chord.
    * Major: Contains the center
    * Minor: Does not contain the center
* Sector: A part of a circle formed by two radii.
    * Major: Reflex angle at the center
    * Minor: An angle less than 180 deg. at the center
