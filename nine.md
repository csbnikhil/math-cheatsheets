* Radius: The distance of any point on the circle from the center of the circle.
* Chord: A line joining any two points on the circle.
* Diameter: A __chord__ passing the center. [fact: a diameter will always be twice the radius]
* Segment: A part of a circle formed by a chord.
    * Major: Contains the center
    * Minor: Does not contain the center
* Sector: A part of a circle formed by two radii.
