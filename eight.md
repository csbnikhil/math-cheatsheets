## Rational Numbers

A number of the form $\frac{p}{q}$ where $q\neq0$.\
It is the super set of integers, that includes all possible fractions.

$Q = {$\frac{p}{q}$ : $p$ and $q$ are co-prime, and $q\neq0$}

#### Identity

Operator  |Identity
----------|-----
$+$       |$0$
$-$       |Has only right identity
$\times$  |$1$
$\div$    |Does not exist

#### Inverse

Let the rational number be $r$.

Operator  |Inverse
----------|-----
$+$       |$-r$
$-$       |N/A
$\times$  |$\frac{1}{r}$
$\div$    |N/A

> $0$ does not have a multiplicative inverse.

### Representaion on the Number Line

On a number line of integers, Rational Numbers appear continuously all over the line (like between
two integers).

### Finding a Rational Number between Two Ints

Let the ints be $a$ and $b$. The Rational Number that lies at the midpoint of those two is
going to be $\frac{a+b}{2}$. You can do the same process to find a mid point
between any two $a$ and $b$ where both can be any rational number.

## Exponents

### Laws

#### Product

$a^m\times{a^n} = a^{m + n}$

#### Quotient

$\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m - n}$

#### Power

$(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$

### Negtaive Integral Exponent

$a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^m}
