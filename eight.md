### Representaion on the Number Line

On a number line of integers, Rational Numbers appear continuously all over the line (like between
two integers).

### Finding a Rational Number between Two Ints

Let the ints be $a$ and $b$. The Rational Number that lies at the midpoint of those two is
going to be $\frac{a+b}{2}$. You can do the same process to find a mid point
between any two $a$ and $b$ where both can be any rational number.

## Exponents

### Laws

#### Product

$a^m\times{a^n} = a^{m + n}$

#### Quotient

$\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m - n}$

#### Power

$(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$

### Negtaive Integral Exponent

$a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^m}$

> $0$ can only have positive exponents.

### More Laws

- $(a\times{b})^n = a^n\times{b^n}$
- $(\frac{a}{b})^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}$
- $a^0 = 1$, provided $a \neq 0$.
- $a^{\frac{m}{n}}$ is $n$th root of $a$ raised to the power of $m$.

## Squared and Square Roots

A square is a number obtained by multiplying another number by itself.\
Let's say $a\times{a}=b$. Here, $b$ is a square number, and $a$ is called the square root of b.

### Perfect Squares

A number whose square root is an integer is called a Perfect Square.

### Finding the Square Root

### Division

- Group the digits in lots of 2, starting from right.
- Find a number whose square is <= the given number.
- Subtract the square from the lot.
- Bring down the next pair.
- Double the quotient and write the result on the left.
- Put the largest possible digit in the unit's place such that
the product of the largest digit and the new number is nearest to the number on the right.
- Repeat.

### Properties

- Always end with 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9.
- Numbers ending with 2, 3, 7, or 8 are not perfect squares.

- If a number ends with n zeroes. its square will have 2n zeroes.
- A perfect square leave a remainder of 0 or 1 when divided by 3.
- $(n + 1)^2 - n^2 = 2n + 1$

## Cubes and Cube Roots

Consider $a\times{a\times{a}} = b$. $b$ is a cube, and $a$ is its cube root.

> Cube of a positive number is always positive, while the cube of a negative
number is always negative.

### Perfect Cube

The cube of a number is called a perfect cube. In other words, a number whose cube root is an integer.

### Cube Roots

#### Finding the Cube Root of a Number

##### Factorization

- Form groups in triplets of the identical primes.
- Take one prime from each and multiply them.
- The result obtained is the cube root of the given number.

## Playing With Numbers

### Generalized Form

$665 = 6\times{100} + 6\times{10} + 5\times{1}$

### Properties

- (ab + ba) % 11 = 0 and (ab + ba) % (a + b) = 0
- |ab - ba| % 9 = 0 and |ab - ba| % |a - b| = 0
- abc + bca + cab = 111(a + b + c)

### Cryptarithms (Letter for Digits)

```

Find A.

### Tests of Divisibility

Refer to [Class IV]().

## Sets

Refer to [Class VI]()

### Subsets

A is a subset of B, if B has all the elements of A, additionally B can also have elements that are not a part of A.

> If A is a subset of B, and B is a subset of A, then A and B are equal sets.

#### Proper Subset

A is a proper subset of B, if B has all the elements in A, and at least one element that does not belong to A.

#### Number of Subsets for a Given Set

For a set containing n elements, there will $2^n$ subsets, and $2^n - 1$ proper subsets.

### Super Set

If A is a subset of B, then B is called the Super Set of A.

### Universal Set

A set that contains all the elements of the subsets under consideration
is called a Universal Set (U).

### Complement Set

complement(A) = U - A

## Percent and Percentage

Refer to [Class VI]()

## Profit, Loss and Discount

Let P be profit, L be loss, CP be Cost Price, and SP be Selling Price.

- P = SP - CP
- L = CP - SP
- P% = (P/CP) x 100
- L% = (L/CP) x 100

### Overheads

When an object is purchased at one place and is taken to another, there will be costs
put for transportation, labor, packing, etc. This additional money is the
Overhead Price.

### Finding SP

$SP = \frac{100 + gain%}{100}\times{CP}$
$SP = \frac{100 - loss%}{100}\times{CP}$

### Finding CP

$CP = \frac{100}{100 + gain%}\times{SP}$
$CP = \frac{100}{100 - gain%}\times{SP}$

### Taxes

- Calculated on the Sale Price
- $tax = \frac{rate\;of\;tax\times{sale\;price}}{100}$
- $rate\;of\;tax = \frac{tax}{sale\;price}\times{100}$

#### VAT

Value Added Tax is a new method of realising tax on the sale/purchase of goods.
In the earlier form of tax, the tax used to be realized at a single point only.
The retailer was liable to pay tax to the government. But with VAT,
the tax is realized at every point, right from the manufacturer to the retailer.

If an article is bought for 800 @ 10% tax, the tax he pays is 80.
If he sells the same at 1150, the tax he recovers is 10% of 1150 = 115.
The differnce between the tax paid and the one recovered after selling is deposited to the govt
as VAT, which is going to be 35 in this case.

## Interest

### Review

- Princpial: Money borrowed / Sum lent
- (Simple) Interest: Amount paid by the borrower to the lender, for the use of money borrowed
- Rate: The interest on every 100 units of money
- Time: The amount of time for which the money is lent / borrowed.
- Amount: The sum of money borrowed and the interest on it.

I depends on P, R and T.

And it can be expressed as $I = \frac{P\times{R}\times{T}}{100}$\
$\therefore A = P\times{(1 + \frac{RT}{100})}$

### Compound Interest

$CI = A - P$

After every cycle, P changes to the new amount.

#### Formula

$A = P\times{(1 + \frac{r\times{t}}{100})^{nt}}$
Here, t is the number of times the interest is compounded, per year.

## Direct and Inverse Variations

- Two quantities are said to be directly related when if one increases, the other also increases.
- Two quantities are said to be inversely related if one increases, the other decreases.

### Direct

The ratio of quantities remains a constant.

### Indirect

The product of quantities remains a constant.

### Unitary Method

### Arrow Method

For direct variations, the arrows point in the same direction,
while they point in the opposite directions for inverse variations.

$\frac{value\;on\;the\;head}{value\;on\;the\;tail}$ is a constant.

### Time and Work

Consider the work to be done as 1 unit.
If a man can finish it in 6 days, he does one sixth of the work in one day.
If a woman can finish it 5 days, she does one fifth of the work each day.
The work done in one day is called the *efficiency*.

### Division

- Arrange the terms of divisor and dividend in ascending or descending
powers of their literal coefficients.
- Divide the first term in the dividend by the first term in the divisor
to obtain the first term of the quotient.
- Multiply the complete divisor by the quotient and subtract.
- Use the remainder as the new dividend.
- Repeat.

### Simplification

Refer to BODMAS - [Class V]().

## Identities

- $(a+b)(a-b)=a^2-b^2$
- $(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2$

## Factorization

### Common Factors

$3x^2y + 6xy^2 - 9xy$

We can see that $3xy$ is common among all the terms. Take it out, and divide all the the terms by it.

$3xy(x + 2y - 3)$

### Grouping

$ax - bx + ay - by$\
$(ax - bx) + (ay - by)$\
$x(a - b) + y(a - b)$\
$(x + y)(a - b)$

### Factorisation of Difference of Two Squares

Callback to Identities: $x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)$

### Factorization of Trinomials

$6x^2 + 11x + 3$

$6x^2\times{3}=18x^2$, so split $11x$ in two, such that their sum is $11x$ and the product $18x^2$.\
You may want to find the factors of 18 and check for a pair whose sum is 11.

$6x^2 + 2x + 9x + 3$\
$2x(3x + 1) + 3(3x + 1)$

#### A Perfectly Square Trinomial

A square of a binomial is called a Square Trinomial.

Can be expressed as $a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ or $a^2 - 2ab + b^2$.

An equation is an expression that states that two algebraic expressions are equal.\
It is called a linear equation if the degree is one.

A linear equation has only one solution and that solution is called its root.

## Understanding Shapes 

### Types of Curves

- open
- closed

Every closed curve divides a plane into three parts: interior, exterior and boundary.

### Polygons

A closed figure bounded by straight line segments.
The line segments forming a polygon intersect only at end points
and each end point is shared by only two line segments.

#### Types

- Convex: no angle is > 180 deg
- Concave: at least one angle > 180 deg

> A diaogonal is line segment joining any two non consecutive virtices.

#### Sum of Angles

$$(n - 2)\times{180}$$

where n is the number of edges in the polygon.

#### Regular

- interior angles are equal
- sides are equal
- exterior angles are equal

As the sum of angles in a polygon of side n will be $(n-1)\times{180}$,
each angle will be equal to $\frac{(n-1)\times{180}}{n}$.

> Sum of exterior angles for any polygon is 360 deg.

- Parallelogram
    - both pairs of opposite sides are parallel.

**Theorem 2**

In a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel and equal, and the diagonals bisect the figure.

**Theorem 3**

If a pair of oppsite sides are parellel and equal, it is a parallelogram.
