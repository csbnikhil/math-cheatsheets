## Rational Numbers

A number of the form $\frac{p}{q}$ where $q\neq0$.\
It is the super set of integers, that includes all possible fractions.

$Q = {$\frac{p}{q}$ : $p$ and $q$ are co-prime, and $q\neq0$}

### Representaion on the Number Line

On a number line of integers, Rational Numbers appear continuously all over the line (like between
two integers).

### Finding a Rational Number between Two Ints

Let the ints be $a$ and $b$. The Rational Number that lies at the midpoint of those two is
going to be $\frac{a+b}{2}$. You can do the same process to find a mid point
between any two $a$ and $b$ where both can be any rational number.

## Exponents

### Laws

#### Product

$a^m\times{a^n} = a^{m + n}$

#### Quotient

$\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m - n}$

#### Power

$(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$

### Negtaive Integral Exponent

$a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^m}$

> $0$ can only have positive exponents.

### More Laws

- $(a\times{b})^n = a^n\times{b^n}$
- $(\frac{a}{b})^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}
- $a^0 = 1$, provided $a \neq 0$.
- $a^{\frac{m}{n}}$ is $n$th root of $a$ raised to the power of $m$.

## Squared and Square Roots

A square is a number obtained by multiplying another number by itself.\
Let's say $a\times{a}=b$. Here, $b$ is a square number, and $a$ is called the square root of b.

### Perfect Squares

A number whose square root is an integer is called a Perfect Square.

### Finding the Square Root

### Division

- Group the digits in lots of 2, starting from right.
- Find a number whose square is <= the given number.
- Subtract the square from the lot.
- Bring down the next pair.
- Double the quotient and write the result on the left.
- Put the largest possible digit in the unit's place such that
the product of the largest digit and the new number is nearest to the number on the right.
- Repeat.

### Properties

- Always end with 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9.
- Numbers ending with 2, 3, 7, or 8 are not perfect squares.

Number's Unit Digit                       |Square's Unit Digit
------------------------------------------|-------------------
0                                         |0
1                                         |1
2                                         |4
3                                         |9
4                                         |6
5                                         |5
6                                         |6
7                                         |9
8                                         |4
9                                         |1

- If a number ends with n zeroes. its square will have 2n zeroes.
- A perfect square leave a remainder of 0 or 1 when divided by 3.
- $(n + 1)^2 - n^2 = 2n + 1$

## Cubes and Cube Roots

Consider $a\times{a\times{a}} = b$. $b$ is a cube, and $a$ is its cube root.

> Cube of a positive number is always positive, while the cube of a negative
number is always negative.

### Perfect Cube

The cube of a number is called a perfect cube. In other words, a number whose cube root is an integer.

### Cube Roots

#### Finding the Cube Root of a Number

##### Factorization

- Split the given number into its primes.
- Form groups in triplets of the identical primes.
- Take one prime from each and multiply them.
- The result obtained is the cube root of the given number.

## Playing With Numbers

### Generalized Form

$665 = 6\times{100} + 6\times{10} + 5\times{1}$

### Properties

- (ab + ba) % 11 = 0 and (ab + ba) % (a + b) = 0
- |ab - ba| % 9 = 0 and |ab - ba| % |a - b| = 0
- abc + bca + cab = 111(a + b + c)

### Cryptarithms (Letter for Digits)

```

 5 0 1
```

Find A.

### Test of Divisibility

Refer to [Class IV]().

## Sets

Refer to [Class VI]()

### Subsets

A is a subset of B, if B has all the elements of A, additionally B can also have elements that are not a part of A.

> If A is a subset of B, and B is a subset of A, then A and B are equal sets.

#### Proper Subset

A is a proper subset of B, if B has all the elements in A, and at least one element that does not belong to A.

#### Number of Subsets for a Given Set

For a set containing n elements, there will $2^n$ subsets, and $2^n - 1$ proper subsets.

### Super Set

If A is a subset of B, then B is called the Super Set of A.

### Universal Set

A set that contains all the elements of the subsets under consideration
is called a Universal Set (U).

### Complement Set

complement(A) = U - A

### Operations

### Union

### Intersection

### Difference
