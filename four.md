## Number Systems

What are numbers?

* Draw an object multiple times on the screen.
* Ask to count.
* The answer to that is going to be a **number**.

How many 1s in a 10?
How many 10s in a 100?
...

When it comes to reading large numbers like 100000, we have a system
to read them with ease - the **Indian and International Number Systems**.

### Periods

A period is a group of digits (usually seperated by `,`).

### Indian Number System

#### Periods

- ones
- thousands
- lakhs
- crores

### International Number System

- ones
- thousands
- millions
- billions

### Place & Face Values

2980346: place value of `4` = `400`, face value = `4`

### Expansion

8123 = 3x1 + 2x10 + 3x100 + 8x1000

### Successors and Predecessors

13 is the successor of 12
89 is the predecessor of 90

### Comparison of Numbers

`>`, `<` and `=`

#### Ascending and Descending Orders

#### Forming The Smallest or The Largest Number

Available Digits: 8, 4, 5, 7, 3

largest  = 87543
smallest = 34578

## Roman Numerals

Ancient number system that Romans used before 0, 1, 2, 3, ... came into existence.

Letter  | Number
------- | ------
I       | 1
V       | 5
X       | 10
L       | 50
C       | 100
D       | 500
M       | 1000

### Rules

* Repeated symbols - add (max repititions allowed: 3)
* Greater number first, smaller number next - add
* Smaller number first, greater number next - subtract


> **Why can't 8 be represented as IIX?**
You can only add or subtract the numbers that have a one character representation in Roman Numerals. 10 - 2 = 8, but 2 cannot be written by using a single Roman Numeral.

## Addition

Explain **counting**.

### Properties

- Commutative
- Identity
- Associative

### Adding Large Numbers

```
 3 4 2 1 0 5
+  3 3 5 9 8
------------
 3 7 5 7 0 3
------------
```

## Multiplication

Repetitive addition

### Properties

- Idenitity
- Zero-Product
- Commutative
- Associative
- Distributive

### Multiplying Larger Numbers

```
  2 4 1
x   2 4
-------
  9 6 4
4 8 2 +
-------
5 7 8 4
-------
```

## Tests of Divisibilty

remainder = 0

### Tests

 1: (not really a test)
 2: units digit = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 [Even and Odd Numbers]
 3: 123456 => 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21, is 21 divisible by 3, or 2 + 1 = 3
 4: units and tens place (similar to 2, because 2x2=4)
 5: units place should be 0 or 5
 6: should pass the tests for 2 and 3, because 2x3=6
 8: units, tens and hundreds (similar to 2, because 2x2x2=8)
 9: 123 => 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 (similar to 3, because 3x3=9)
10: units digit must be 0
11: sum up alterate numbers starting from position 1 and 2, and subtract the sums

## Geometry

Object  | Length  | Breadth  | Thickness
------- | :-----: | :------: | :------: 
Point   | -       | -        | -
Line    | +       | -        | -
Plane   | +       | +        | -

### Terms

- **Point**: A dot. Shows a definite position on a plane. 0 dimensions, meaning - no shape, size... Represented by capital letters.
- **Line**: A line has no thickness, no breadth and no end points. 1 dimension.
- **Plane**: A surface, 2D, meaning â€” no thickness.
